                            <p>Ella Models started in 1983 in a meagre house just outside the city of USA. 
    From those humble beginnings, we became the first New York modelling agency to represent a diverse 
    selection of models from all nationalities, ethnicities and ages. We’ve continued to grow and now 
    represent hundreds of diverse models across all specialties in USA and New York.</p>
<p> We are committed to building strong and lasting relationships with both our clients and our models. 
    With a large professional team of agents and bookers covering every speciality, our goal is to be seen as 
    the modelling agency by which all others are measured. By delivering a personal service and support for 
    both clients and models we aim to achieve this ambitious goal.</p>
    <p>We continue to promote diversity in modelling and now have a wide range of models in a full range of 
        specialties including mainboard female models, curve models, 30’s models with timeless qualities 
        and over 40’s classic models, and including hand and parts models, sports models and influencers. 
        Our models grace the covers of magazines, are seen in TV commercials, at fashion shows and in top 
        advertising campaigns. So, if you’re looking for a USA based modelling agency for an upcoming project 
        then we’d love to hear from you.</p>
